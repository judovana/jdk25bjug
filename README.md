From JDK8 to JDK11, java made a gigantic leap. over 17 to 21 its direction get clear - to remove legacy bad things (jar hell...), to keep peace with modern development styles and languages, keep boosting performance, scale but still still keep extensive stability, and backward compatibility.
We will summarize what happened since that time, and what new features will arrive.

JDK25 was early adapted already since June, as many accepted features were simply already finished (mostly thanx to preview/experimental approaches) and merged early to stabilize.
Based on this, we will try to come with as much demos as possible, so save your time.
